# fivem-resource-template-generator
This is a small script written in js that uses the electron library to render a window that allows creation of blank scripting and mlo resource folders

# INCLUDED
- source files if you wish to add / remove features and tweak HTML
- ouput folder selection
- example FXManifest for both scripting resource and MLO resource

# WHY
- i made this as a little experiment for chatGPT v 5.1 i had already made a CLI tool to do this and wanted to see if AI could add the interface (hence why it says vibecoded cus i totally coded the vibe)
